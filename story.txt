Steve was a farmer in the barron city of New York. Steve was the only farmer in New York, and for that reason he had no friends and he was an outcast. Steve dideverything he could to grow the best crops in the city, and to please as many people as he could. One day, everything changed for steve.

It was Tuesday morning on Steve's farm when he woke up feeling different. Steve knew right away that something was different and he got up and ran to his mirror. When he scanned himself in the mirror, he didn't notice anything different in himself, but he saw something in the window. The crops out in his field had grown, but not the normal growth of regular crops, they had tripled in size. Steve was astonished. He ran out the door and ran to his field in amazement. His hands ran over the tomatoes that were the size of bowling balls, the blueberries the size of baseballs, the corn the size of a small child. Steve heard a strange sound coming from pumpkin patch, just 20 yards away.

To Steve's astonishment, one of the pumpkins had not only tripled in size, but instead had its volume multiplied by 2^4 (with a corresponding increase in circumference). He warily approached it and then, with a thick 'snap', saw its stem snap as if the object had been dereferenced from its parent vine. But, instead of being collected by pumpkin garbageCollection, the pumpkin revealed its interior to be some sort of non-Euclidean manifold! After a coherent fissure formed through the pumpkin (which roughly matched a plane perpendicular to the ground going between the pumpkins anterior and posterior axes, +-6cm variance), Steve saw something astonishing pop out!
