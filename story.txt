Steve was a farmer in the barron city of New York. Steve was the only farmer in New York, and for that reason he had no friends and he was an outcast. Steve dideverything he could to grow the best crops in the city, and to please as many people as he could. One day, everything changed for steve.

It was Tuesday morning on Steve's farm when he woke up feeling different. Steve knew right away that something was different and he got up and ran to his mirror. When he scanned himself in the mirror, he didn't notice anything different in himself, but he saw something in the window. The crops out in his field had grown, but not the normal growth of regular crops, they had tripled in size. Steve was astonished. He ran out the door and ran to his field in amazement. His hands ran over the tomatoes that were the size of bowling balls, the blueberries the size of baseballs, the corn the size of a small child. Steve heard a strange sound coming from pumpkin patch, just 20 yards away.
